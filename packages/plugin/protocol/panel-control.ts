/**
 * The panel's own control channel: messages the UI iframe sends up to the sandbox to drive the
 * plugin _window_ itself — resize it, hide it, or jump the canvas to a node.
 *
 * It is a channel of its own, separate from the tool bridge (`@frameforge/shared`'s
 * `PluginBridgeMessage`), because direction and shape differ: tool traffic is a two-way
 * request/response RPC that originates with the agent, while these are one-way commands the human's
 * own clicks produce. Its own tag lets `figma.ui.onmessage` split the two with a single string
 * compare, and lets either side add a message kind with no chance of colliding with the other.
 *
 * It lives _beside_ `src/` and `ui/` rather than inside either, because neither end owns it. Those
 * two are execution contexts, not modules: they build into separate bundles, the sandbox has
 * `figma` and no DOM, the panel a DOM and no `figma`, and neither one's runtime code can import the
 * other's. Both can import this precisely because it touches neither environment — types, constants
 * and pure functions only — and sitting outside both is what keeps that constraint legible. Nothing
 * enforces it: one tsconfig covers all three trees, so a stray `document` in here would typecheck
 * and then fail at runtime inside the sandbox.
 *
 * That placement also keeps it clear of `@frameforge/shared`, which binds a different pair — plugin
 * and server. Two names for two boundaries; filing this there would erode `shared` into "things
 * more than one file happens to need".
 *
 * Both ends of the plugin import this module, which is what makes the window's floor and its
 * clamping rule a single fact rather than two implementations that drift apart.
 *
 * Validation is hand-written rather than Zod (which the bridge protocol in `shared` does use), for
 * a reason worth stating: the bridge crosses a process boundary between independently-versioned
 * peers and carries `unknown` tool params, so it needs a schema. This channel's two ends ship in
 * one plugin build and are deployed atomically — there is no version skew to absorb, and the
 * payloads are five scalars. A guard keeps the check exact without making `zod` a direct dependency
 * of a package that has three.
