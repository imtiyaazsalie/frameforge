 * Binding to 127.0.0.1 keeps the LAN out; it does not keep the user's own browser out. Two distinct
 * paths lead from a web page to a local port, and they need two distinct checks:
 *
 * - **Cross-site.** A page can open a WebSocket to a local port (WebSockets have no same-origin
 *   policy) or POST a CORS "simple request" to one. It can't read the reply, but the side effect
 *   already happened. Such a request carries an `Origin` the page cannot forge → gated by origin.
 * - **DNS rebinding.** A page on attacker.com whose DNS re-resolves to 127.0.0.1 reaches us as
 *   _same-origin_, so a GET carries no `Origin` at all and the reply IS readable. What it cannot
 *   change is `Host`, which still names the attacker's domain → gated by host.
 *
 * The MCP security best practices ("Local MCP Server Compromise") name DNS rebinding explicitly;
 * the host gate follows the shape Playwright uses for its own local servers.
