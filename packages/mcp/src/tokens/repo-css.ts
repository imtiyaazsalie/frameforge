// token source (no reliable marker exists, unlike Tailwind's @import/@theme), aggregate the custom
// properties from every hand-authored CSS file and let token_map's join filter them: a Figma variable
// only surfaces a candidate when name- or value-match agrees, so incidental vars (--header-height,
// reset rules) sit in the pool unmatched and never reach the output. Worst case the pool matches
// nothing and the result is identical to today's empty join — so the fallback can't regress.
