/**
 * Build timestamp (epoch ms) baked into the bundle by tsdown (see tsdown.config.ts `define`).
 * Newest-build-wins election orders server processes by it: a follower running a strictly newer
 * build asks a stale leader to abdicate (see election/election.ts), which is what keeps a
 * long-lived old process — another session's server, or one launched by hand — from serving stale
 * code forever. Published releases get their publish-time build stamp, so the ordering holds across
 * versions too, without parsing semver.
 *
 * When running unbundled (vitest, tsx) the define is absent and this is 0: an unbundled process
 * never claims to be newer than a real build, and two 0s never trigger an abdication.
