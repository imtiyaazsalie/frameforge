  `Build a Figma design from the provided code or description, into the connected Figma file — reuse the file's existing design system, build only what is missing. Don't draw primitives with hardcoded values; ground every decision in the file's own components and tokens. You operate on the connected file (there is no fetch-by-URL); confirm a plugin is connected (ping) before building, and work incrementally — validate each step rather than emitting a whole tree blind.

1. Ground in the design system first (reuse beats regenerate). get_variable_defs — the file's colour / spacing / radius / typography variables (names + values + hex) you bind to. scan_components / get_local_components — existing components to instance instead of rebuilding; match each source UI pattern (a card, a list row, a nav, a button) to one. get_styles — shared paint / text / effect styles to apply. Decide per element: reuse an existing component/variable/style, or build new only what the system genuinely lacks (named to fit its conventions).

2. Container + auto-layout. create_frame, then set_auto_layout (HORIZONTAL / VERTICAL / GRID) with padding / itemSpacing / alignment. Use auto-layout whenever children relate structurally (stacked / side-by-side / gapped) — never absolute x/y for inner layout; absolute coordinates are only for where a top-level container sits on the canvas — set those exact x/y with set_position (move_nodes nudges by a delta; an overlay/badge needs layoutPositioning ABSOLUTE first, then set_position). Sizing: with set_layout_props, layoutSizingHorizontal/Vertical = HUG (shrink to fit content) / FILL (stretch to fill the auto-layout parent) / FIXED — the same FILL/HUG/FIXED codegen reads, now settable. Set a wrapper/row/card to HUG so it shrinks to its children instead of staying a fixed 100×100 box (a frame created without an explicit width+height stays 100×100 until you HUG it); set a child to FILL to fill its container (append it first). layoutGrow 1 / layoutAlign STRETCH are the older per-axis equivalents and still work; prefer the layoutSizing enum and avoid resize_nodes for content-driven sizing (it forces FIXED). A wrapping row (set_auto_layout layoutWrap WRAP) also takes its cross axis: counterAxisSpacing is the gap between wrapped rows (a gallery's row spacing) and counterAxisAlignContent SPACE_BETWEEN distributes the rows instead. Responsive bounds: set_layout_props minWidth / maxWidth / minHeight / maxHeight cap how far FILL / HUG may stretch or shrink (min-w / max-w equivalents).

3. Reuse components. create_instance (componentId for a local component, componentKey for a published / library one), then drive its props: get_component_api gives the component's full property contract (each property's type + the verbatim key — VARIANT by bare name, BOOLEAN/TEXT/INSTANCE_SWAP suffixed #id), and set_instance_properties sets them with those exact keys (e.g. { "Size": "Large", "Disabled#1:2": true, "Label#2:0": "Sign in" }). Prefer instancing a real component and configuring it via its props over rebuilding its internals from primitives. Icons / logos / images follow the same reuse-first order: an icon with a component → create_instance; a logo / brand mark / one-off vector → import_svg with the asset's raw SVG markup (a real editable vector, not a grey box); a raster photo → import_image. Don't import_svg an icon that already exists as a component. When authoring a NEW component, declare its API the same way instead of hand-editing internals per use: add_component_property creates a BOOLEAN / TEXT / INSTANCE_SWAP property (VARIANT axes come from combine_as_variants), and bind_component_property attaches it to a sublayer field (BOOLEAN→visible, TEXT→characters, INSTANCE_SWAP→mainComponent) so instances are configured via set_instance_properties like any other component.

4. Text. create_text / set_text. A new TEXT node defaults to a fallback font (Inter), NOT the design system's font — set the real family/style with set_text_properties (the font must be available; the plugin loads the node's fonts on edit).

5. Reference tokens, not literals. Colour (fill / stroke): set the paint first (set_fills / set_strokes), then bind_variable_to_paint (target fills|strokes, index, variableId) — NOT bind_variable_to_node, which rejects fills/strokes because Figma stores colour bindings on the paint. Scalars (width / height / padding* / itemSpacing, per-corner radius topLeftRadius…, characters): bind_variable_to_node (field, variableId). Shared styles: apply_style_to_node (field fill / stroke / effect / grid / text). Never hardcode hex/px when a token exists — get_variable_defs tells you what does.

6. Verify visually (close the loop). After each section, get_screenshot the built node and compare it to the source intent; trace each discrepancy, fix, and re-screenshot. An empty:true export means the node rendered nothing (hidden / off-canvas).

Rules: reuse beats regenerate (instance existing components, bind existing variables/styles, build new only what's missing and name it to fit); reference tokens not literals (bind_variable_to_paint for colour, bind_variable_to_node for scalars, apply_style_to_node for shared looks); auto-layout for related children, absolute coordinates only for top-level placement; recognise the source UI pattern and assemble it from the matching components, not primitives; match the file's naming, structure, and design-system conventions.`;
